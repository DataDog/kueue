## Summary

This KEP proposes a mechanism to allow external admission check controllers to specify retry delays when marking a workload's admission check state as `Retry`. Currently, when an admission check is set to `Retry`, Kueue immediately evicts the workload and requeues it with minimal delay, which can cause excessive load on external controllers and the control plane.

## Motivation

Kueue supports custom admission checks that allow external controllers to influence workload admission decisions. When an external controller sets an admission check state to `Retry`, Kueue currently:

1. Evicts the workload
2. Releases the quota reservation
3. Immediately requeues the workload with minimal delay

This immediate retry behavior can cause several issues:

- Excessive load on external admission check controllers
- Unnecessary churn in the control plane
- Inefficient resource utilization when the retry condition is expected to persist for a known duration
- Artificial reduction of available quotas

Currently, there is a shared `.status.requeueState` field that was introduced specifically for the provisioning request admission check. However, as this field is shared between all admission checks, it will lead to concurrency issues if used more widely. Additionally, the current approach does not provide a way to configure different retry delays for different admission checks.

### Goals

- Provide a mechanism for external admission check controllers to specify retry delays
- Allow each admission check to independently manage its retry timing
- Migrate the existing `requeueState` mechanism to the new per-admission-check system
- Provide helper libraries for common retry strategies (fixed delay, exponential backoff)
- Support proper coordination of multiple admission checks with different retry delays

### Non-Goals

- Change the behavior of other admission check states (`Ready`, `Rejected`, `Pending`)
- Reactivate the deprecated `AdmissionCheck.Spec.RetryDelayMinutes` field
- Modify the FIFO ordering guarantees for workloads without retry delays
- Change the retry behavior for admission checks that don't specify a delay

## Proposal

Add new fields to the `AdmissionCheckState` status to support per-admission-check retry delays:

- `retryAfter`: A timestamp indicating when this admission check should be retried
- `retryCount`: A counter tracking how many times this admission check has been retried

When multiple admission checks are in the `Retry` state with different delays, Kueue will use the maximum delay across all checks.
Besides that, the old behavior remains unchanged. When all admission checks are in the `Ready` state, the workload will be admitted; if any of them are in the `Rejected` state, the workload will be rejected.

### User Stories

#### Story 1: External Admission Check with Backoff

As a developer of an external admission check controller that validates cloud resource availability, I want to implement exponential backoff when resources are temporarily unavailable, so that I don't overwhelm the cloud API with requests.

When my controller detects that required cloud resources are not available, it can:

1. Set the admission check state to `Retry`
2. Calculate an appropriate backoff delay (e.g., 30s, 1m, 2m, 4m)
3. Set `retryAfter` to the calculated future timestamp
4. Track retry attempts using `retryCount`

#### Story 2: Control Plane Load Management

As a cluster administrator, I have an admission check that validates whether the Kubernetes control plane is healthy before admitting large workloads. When the control plane is under stress, I want workloads to be delayed with longer intervals to allow recovery.

The admission check controller can:

1. Detect control plane stress (high API server latency, etcd performance issues)
2. Set workloads to `Retry` with delays proportional to the stress level
3. Prevent thundering herd effects by spreading retry times

#### Story 3: Multi-tenancy with Different Retry Strategies

As a platform engineer supporting multiple teams, I want different admission checks to have independent retry strategies based on their specific requirements without interfering with each other.

For example:

- Security scanning admission check: retry after 5 minutes if scanner is busy
- Resource provisioning check: retry after 1 minute if capacity is being added
- Compliance validation check: retry after 10 minutes if external audit service is down

### Notes/Constraints/Caveats

- The retry delay is advisory; the actual delay might be slightly longer due to reconciliation timing
- Workloads with very long retry delays might appear to be "stuck" to users
- When multiple admission checks specify different retry delays, the workload will not be retried until all delays have expired
- The retry mechanism does not guarantee strict FIFO ordering when delays are involved
- There is a potential race condition where Kueue might reset admission check states before all controllers have set their retry delays

### Risks and Mitigations

**Risk**: Breaking backward compatibility with existing admission check controllers\
**Mitigation**: The new fields are optional; controllers that don't set them will maintain current behavior

**Risk**: Workloads appearing stuck due to long retry delays \
**Mitigation**: Add clear status messages that indicate the retry time, expose metrics to monitor retry delays, and document the recommended maximum delay values.

**Risk**: Resource leakage if workloads are forgotten during long delays \
**Mitigation**: Ensure proper cleanup mechanisms and consider maximum delay limits

**Risk**: Race conditions when multiple admission checks set delays \
**Mitigation**: Allow and support admission checks to update the state after a workload has been evicted.

## Design Details

### API Changes

Add new fields to `AdmissionCheckState` in `workload_types.go`:

```go
type AdmissionCheckState struct {
    // Existing fields remain unchanged...

    // RetryAfter indicates when this check should be retried.
    // When State=Retry, admission check controllers should set this
    // to implement delays between retry attempts.
    //
    // If nil when State=Retry, Kueue will retry immediately.
    // If set, Kueue will not re-evaluate until this time has passed.
    //
    // Example: To retry in 5 minutes:
    //   retryAfter = &metav1.Time{Time: time.Now().Add(5*time.Minute)}
    //
    // +optional
    RetryAfter *metav1.Time `json:"retryAfter,omitempty"`

    // RetryCount tracks retry attempts for this admission check.
    // Kueue automatically increments this when transitioning from
    // Retryâ†’Pending. Reset to 0 when check succeeds or workload
    // is admitted.
    //
    // Controllers can use this for retry strategies:
    // - Exponential backoff: delay = baseDelay * (2^retryCount)
    // - Linear backoff: delay = baseDelay * retryCount
    // - Max retries: if retryCount > limit, set State=Rejected
    //
    // +optional
    RetryCount *int32 `json:"retryCount,omitempty"`
}
```

#### Example: Workload Status with Multiple Admission Checks

```yaml
apiVersion: kueue.x-k8s.io/v1beta1
kind: Workload
metadata:
  name: ml-training-job
  namespace: research
status:
  conditions:
    - type: QuotaReserved
      status: "True"
      lastTransitionTime: "2024-02-06T10:00:00Z"

  admissionChecks:
    # Check 1: Budget check with daily reset
    - name: budget-check
      state: Retry
      lastTransitionTime: "2024-02-06T10:30:00Z"
      message: "Daily budget exhausted. Will retry at midnight."
      retryAfter: "2024-02-07T00:00:00Z" # Retry at midnight
      retryCount: 1

    # Check 2: GPU availability with exponential backoff
    - name: gpu-availability
      state: Retry
      lastTransitionTime: "2024-02-06T10:30:00Z"
      message: "No A100 GPUs available. Retrying in 8m (attempt 4)"
      retryAfter: "2024-02-06T10:38:00Z" # 8 minutes from now
      retryCount: 4

    # Check 3: License server check - immediate retry
    - name: license-check
      state: Retry
      lastTransitionTime: "2024-02-06T10:30:00Z"
      message: "License server temporarily unavailable"
      # No retryAfter set - will retry immediately
# In this example, Kueue will wait until 00:00:00Z (the longest delay)
# before re-evaluating all admission checks
```

### Controller Changes

1. **Workload Controller** (`pkg/controller/core/workload_controller.go`):

   - When processing admission checks in `Retry` state, calculate the maximum `retryAfter` across all checks
   - Set workload requeue time based on the calculated delay
   - Increment `retryCount` when transitioning back to `Pending`
   - Remove the existing `requeueState` logic and migrate to per-admission-check retry handling

2. **Helper Functions**:

   - Add utilities for calculating backoff delays (similar to existing `UpdateRequeueState` in `pkg/workload/workload.go`)
   - Provide standard implementations for fixed delay and exponential backoff strategies

### Scheduler Changes

The scheduler (`pkg/scheduler/scheduler.go`) will need updates to:

- Respect retry delays when processing workloads
- Ensure workloads are not scheduled before their retry time has elapsed

### Problem: Race Condition Between Admission Check Updates and Workload Eviction

The current implementation has critical issues with how admission checks are processed. The system uses a small state machine that reacts immediately to changes in the admission check state. When one admission check sets the status to `Retry`, Kueue evicts the workload right away. This immediate action prevents other admission checks from updating their status afterward. If another check sets the status to `Retry` after eviction, it can break Kueueâ€™s internal state. Therefore, the order of events must be strictly followed. The challenge here is that to wait for the maximum time, we need to know all potential delays in advance.

  kueue -> kueue: Reserve Quota
  kueue ->> kube: Push WL update
  deactivate kueue
```

The diagram above shows the current flow of a workload with two admission checks:

- Both admission checks will set the state to `Retry`
- Kueue will take actions after the first one applies its result (steps 10-13)
- The second admission check should not update its status after the workload got evicted (step 14)
  - Otherwise, it will cause issues in Kueue's internal state machine

This is a fundamental problem for delayed retries as we can never know the maximum delay if Kueue reacts to the first response.

  deactivate ac1
  kueue -> kueue: Wait for 1m
  kueue -> kueue: Requeue Workload
  kueue -> kueue: Reserve Quota
  kueue ->> kube: Push WL update
  deactivate kueue
```

This updated version of the diagram includes potential delays:

- Admission check 1 sets the status to retry with a delay of one minute (step 10)
- Kueue will immediately take action and evict the workload (step 12 + 13)
- Shortly after, admission check 2 wants to set its state to retry too, but can't as the workload was evicted already (step 14)
  - However, it would have set a higher retry delay than admission check one
  - This means that we'll always only use the delay of the fastest responding check

##### What happens if the second AC updates it's state at the wrong time?

When the admission check controller is too fast and doesn't implement proper safeguards, it can lead to invalid states where a workload won't be reconsidered by Kueue anymore.
The following sequence of events illustrates how this issue can eventually break a workload:

1. User creates a workload.
2. Kueue reserves quota and applies changes in two steps:
   2.1 Applies a patch to set resource flavour information and sets `QuotaReserved=true`.
   2.2 Applies an update to `add admission checks to the status in a pending state`.
3. The admission check controller runs because `QuotaReserved=true` and `AdmissionCheckState=Pending`:
   3.1 It applies a patch to `set the admission check state to retry`.
4. Kueue `resets the admission check state to Pending` and sets `Evicted=true` in a single patch.
5. The admission check controller runs again under the same conditions:
   5.1 It `sets the admission check state back to retry`.
6. Kueue does not notice the change and sets `QuotaReserved=false` and `Requeue=false` in a single patch
   6.1 Evicted remains true, and QuotaReserved is false.
   6.2 The admission check state stays in Retry.
7. Kueue sets `Requeued=true`.
8. Kueue can't reserve quota again due to the invalid state. It tries to schedule the workload but always sees the admission check in a Retry state.
   8.1 The message on the QuotaReserved status: The workload has failed admission checks.

At this point, the workload should theoretically be picked up by the scheduler again. However, it's ignored because the admission check remains in a Retry state that is never cleared.
We mitigated this issue by being more cautious with updates in our custom admission checks. Specifically, by avoiding state changes at the wrong time. However, this behavior was not immediately obvious.

#### Solution: Delayed Processing and State Reconciliation

To address these issues, the implementation will be changed to allow admission check updates after a workload has been evicted. When an admission check state is set to `Retry` or `Ready`, after eviction, Kueue should reset the state to `Pending` and defer any immediate action. Instead of scheduling a timer in `pkg/controller/core/workload_controller.go:807` that sets the requeuing in the future, the controller should rely on the Reconcile function for managing delays. Whenever the workload gets re-submitted to be reconciled, it should search for the latest delay across all admission checks. If the calculated retry time is in the future, the reconciler should reprocess the workload with a delay. If it's in the past, the reconciler should add the workload back into the scheduling rotation.

![This is how the reconciler would work high level](reconciler-flow.png "Reconciler flow")

This diagram shows the updated approach where admission check one sets the state to Retry with a delay of one minute (step 10), and Kueue evicts the workload (step 12 + 13). Crucially, admission check two is able to push its update even after the workload has been evicted, and Kueue will take this new delay into account. The rest of the flow remains the same as before. This approach ensures that all admission checks have the opportunity to set their retry delays, and Kueue will respect the maximum delay across all checks.

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
  autonumber
  actor user as User
  participant kueue as Kueue
  participant kube as Kube API Server
  participant ac1 as Admission Check 1
  participant ac2 as Admission Check 2

  user ->> kube: Create Workload
  kube -->> kueue: New WL event
  activate kueue
    kueue -> kueue: Reserve Quota
    kueue -> kueue: Attach admission check information
    kueue ->> kube: Push WL update
  deactivate kueue
  kube -->> ac1: WL update event
  activate ac1
  kube -->> ac2: WL update event
  activate ac2
  ac1 ->> ac1: Perform checks
  ac2 ->> ac2: Perform checks
  ac2 ->> kube: Set AC to retry with 1m delay
  deactivate ac2
  kube -->> kueue: WL update event
  kueue ->> kube: Reset admission check states
  kueue ->> kube: Evict Workload
  activate kueue
  kueue --> kueue: Don't retry as retry after is not done (in 1m)
  ac1 ->> kube: Set AC to retry with 2m delay
  kueue --> kueue: Don't retry as retry after is not done (in 2m)
  deactivate ac1
  kueue -> kueue: Reserve Quota
  kueue ->> kube: Push WL update
  deactivate kueue
```

##### Caveats

In the new case, there's still a race condition if one admission check is fast and doesn't set any delay, which means that the workload will be retries immediately.
However, this shouldn't be a problem, since the update can be posted at any time. This means the second admission check will eventually set the retry with a delay, ensuring it's not reworked immediately again.
That said, it still means we go through a couple of unnecessary cycles, which should be okay.

#### Alternative: Wait for All Admission Checks

One alternative approach would be to have Kueue wait for all admission checks to complete before taking any eviction action. This would ensure that all admission checks have the opportunity to set their retry delays, and Kueue could then use the maximum delay across all checks.

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
  autonumber
  actor user as User
  participant kueue as Kueue
  participant kube as Kube API Server
  participant ac1 as Admission Check 1
  participant ac2 as Admission Check 2

  user ->> kube: Create Workload
  kube -->> kueue: New WL event
  activate kueue
    kueue -> kueue: Reserve Quota
    kueue -> kueue: Attach admission check information
    kueue ->> kube: Push WL update
  deactivate kueue
  kube -->> ac1: WL update event
  activate ac1
  kube -->> ac2: WL update event
  activate ac2
  ac1 ->> ac1: Perform checks
  ac2 ->> ac2: Perform checks
  ac2 ->> kube: Set AC to retry with 1m delay
  deactivate ac2
  kube -->> kueue: WL update event
  kueue -> kueue: Ignore as not all ACs are done
  ac1 ->> kube: Set AC to retry with 2m delay
  deactivate ac1
  kube -->> kueue: WL update event
  kueue ->> kube: Reset admission check states
  kueue ->> kube: Evict Workload
  activate kueue
  kueue -> kueue: Wait for 2m
  kueue -> kueue: Reserve Quota
  kueue ->> kube: Push WL update
  deactivate kueue
```

This diagram shows the alternative flow where admission check one sets the state to retry with delay, and Kueue ignores it initially. Only after admission check two returns a result does Kueue take action and start to evict the workload. However, this approach has significant disadvantages:

**Breaking Backwards Compatibility**: The behavior fundamentally changes from the current implementation. Where Kueue would evict or reject a workload immediately upon the first admission check failure, it would now wait for all admission checks to respond. This could affect existing workload behaviors and expectations.

**Risk of Stuck Workloads**: If one of the admission check controllers becomes unresponsive or is unable to set the status, a workload would be stuck indefinitely in the admission phase. This also means that the quota reservation would be held forever, potentially starving other workloads in the queue. This creates a new failure mode that doesn't exist in the current implementation.

Due to these significant drawbacks, this alternative was rejected in favor of the solution described before.

### Documentation Requirements

To ensure proper implementation of admission check controllers, the following documentation should be added:

- **Admission Check Flow Guide**: Detailed documentation on the expected flow and behavior of admission checks, including:

  - Proper handling of state transitions
  - Best practices for setting retry delays
  - Guidelines on when and how to update admission check states
  - Examples of correct implementation patterns

- **Migration Guide**: Step-by-step instructions for migrating from the old `requeueState` mechanism to the new per-admission-check retry system

### Test Plan

#### Observability

The following metrics will be added:

- admission_retry_delay_seconds
- admission_retry_total
- workload_admission_retry_duration_seconds
- workloads_pending_admission_retry
- admission_late_updates_total

#### Unit Tests

- Test retry delay calculation with single and multiple admission checks
- Test backward compatibility with existing retry behavior

#### Integration tests

- End-to-end test with external admission check setting retry delays
- Test interaction between multiple admission checks with different delays
- Test workload flow through retry cycles with delays
- Performance tests to ensure no regression in scheduling throughput
- Test that the workload state remains consistent when admission checks post updates after workload eviction
- Verify that late admission check updates are properly handled without corrupting the state machine

## Implementation History

- 2025-07-21: Initial KEP proposal

## Drawbacks

- Adds complexity to the admission check state machine
- Potential for workloads to be delayed for extended periods
- Will break strict FIFO ordering guarantees in some scenarios

## Alternatives

1. **Global retry configuration per AdmissionCheck**: Reactivate and enhance the deprecated `retryDelayMinutes` field in the AdmissionCheck spec. This was rejected because:

   - It doesn't allow for dynamic retry strategies
   - All workloads would use the same fixed delay

2. **Shared retry configuration**: Continue using the existing `requeueState` mechanism. This was rejected because:

   - It creates race conditions between multiple admission checks
   - Only one admission check can effectively control the retry delay

3. **Separate AdmissionCheckRetryState status field**: Add a new top-level status field to the Workload that contains all retry-related information for admission checks:

   ```go
   type WorkloadStatus struct {
       // Existing fields...

       // New field for retry state
       AdmissionCheckRetryState *AdmissionCheckRetryState `json:"admissionCheckRetryState,omitempty"`
   }

   type AdmissionCheckRetryState struct {
       // Map of admission check name to retry information
       RetryInfo map[string]RetryInfo `json:"retryInfo"`
   }

   type RetryInfo struct {
       RetryAfter *metav1.Time `json:"retryAfter,omitempty"`
       RetryCount *int32 `json:"retryCount,omitempty"`
   }
   ```

   This approach would provide centralized retry information that cannot be accidentally erased when updating individual admission check states. It would create a clear separation between admission check state and retry metadata, and could potentially make it easier to query and monitor retry states across workloads.

   **This was rejected because:**

   - Creates confusion about where retry information should be set and read
   - Adds another top-level status field that admission check controllers need to update
   - Increases API complexity with multiple locations for related information
   - Requires admission check controllers to update two different parts of the workload status
   - Makes it harder to understand the complete state of an admission check at a glance
